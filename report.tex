\begin{abstract}
Machine translation (MT) is the task of automatically  translating  a  text from
one natural language into another. Ever since the invention of modern computers,
MT  has been  one of the  applications that envisioned  to be automated. In  the
recent years,the  progress in  MT has been  tremendous. In  today's mobile phone
era,  the need for MT systems is only  growing and  the demand  has grown beyond
just text  translation.  Live translation on video conferences  is possible with
the current MT systems. In this article, we discuss the  latest improvements  in
the MT research and highlight the most important breakthroughs.

\section{Deep Learning}
In the recent  years,  Deep  learning has  been making a big  impact  in various
fields of computer science. This impact is profound  in  the perceptual learning
task  in  the  fields like computer vision, natural  language  processing,  etc,
\cite{lecun2015deep}. Though the idea of training a multi layered neural network
to perform function  approximation  is  known to the research community  for  at
least  a couple  of  decades\cite{schmidhuber2015deep},  due  to the  nature  of
training  problem  requiring  large computational  resources, the multi  layered
neural  network remained  less  practical. With the  advent  of general  purpose
graphical  processing units(GPGPUs) and  the availability  of training data, the
neural  networks  are now a practical solution for many perceptual tasks. One of
the early success of deep learning was in  the field of image classification. In
the  annual ImageNet classification  challenge \cite{deng2009imagenet},  AlexNet
\cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet} showed a  remarkable improvement  in the state-of-
the-art  accuracy.  Within  a  few years, more sophisticated  architectures like
Google  Inception  Network \cite{szegedy2016rethinking},  Deep  Residual Network
\cite{he2016deep}, etc., has improved the accuracy to be comparable with a human
in that task. The generality of the neural network made it easily possible to be
used for a wide variety of tasks. With more people  working on deep learning and
the ideas arising in solving on the problems being easily transferable, the deep
learning  is the  state-of-the-art for  many learning  tasks. In  the  following
section, we will briefly summarize the basics of deep learning.


The  basic  building block of a  Multilayer network, or  in more technical  term
Multilayer  perceptron  (MLP)  is a  perceptron.  The  preceptron  \ref{fig:ann}
closely resembles a neuron in a human brain. A preceptron takes
a set of input  values,  computes a weighted sum of  the  inputs, and outputs  a
scalar value of a after applying an activation function (mostly non-linear). The
weights for  computing  the  weighted  sum and  the threshold  in the activation
function  are initially  set to random values and are learned  from the training
data. Mathematically, a perceptron with the  weight matrix $A$ and the threshold
$T$  for  an  step activation function, for the  input vector $x$,  outputs  the
following,


\[
  f(x)=
  \begin{cases}
    1, & \text{if }  A x > c \\
    0, & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
\]


A layer has many number of neurons and many layers are stacked one on top of the
other to form a MLP. An  MLP  with very  many layers is  called  as Deep  Neural
Network(DNN). In the following section we will discuss  the properties  of  DNNs
and how they are useful in the context of supervised machine learning.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Supervised  learning}   Supervised  learning   is   the  problem  of
predicting an new output $y^\prime$ for a new  input $x^\prime$,
and set of training  data that provides a  set of  input and output $\{x \mapsto
y\}$. Most of the supervised learning problems  can be  formulated  as either  a
classification   or  regression   problem.  Classification  is  the  problem  of
predicting the  label for a given $x^\prime$ among a set of given labels
$\{Y\}$  while regression  of predicting a continuous valued output for  a given
input. The usual way  of  doing supervised learning  is to extract features from
the given data and train a model to perform classification or regression.


\begin{equation*}
  x
  \xrightarrow[\text{Feature extraction}]{
    \mathbb{D}(x)
  }
  x^\prime
  _{intermediate}
  \xrightarrow[\text{classifier/regressor}]{
    \mathbb{F}(x^\prime | \theta)
  }
  y
\end{equation*}


The  power of the  DNNs lie in  the fact  that the  models learns  the  features
directly from the given training data and avoids hand  engineered features.


\begin{equation*}
  x \xrightarrow[ \text{hierarchical}] { \mathbb{M}(x | \Theta) } y
\end{equation*}


The DNNs  with neurons in one  layers being connected to all the neurons  in the
next  layer  are  called  Feed Forward Networks. The feed  forward networks  are
harder  to train since  they have lots  of parameters. To make  a the DNNs learn
useful representation for performing supervised learning,  we need special types
of  connections  between  the  neurons.  Two  of  the  most  commonly  used  DNN
architectures  are  Convolutional  Neural  Networks(CNN)  and  Recurrent  Neural
Networks(RNN). In the following section  we  will discuss these architectures in
detail.

  \label{fig:enc_dec}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{RNN}

The neurons  in the RNNs have recurrent self connections. i.e. the output of the
neurons  are connected back to the inputs. Thus the output at time step $t_1$ is
computed  with taking  output  at  time  step  $t_0$  as  input.  The  recurrent
connections  are  shown  Fig. \ref{fig:rnn}  This  enables  the RNNs to have  an
internal  memory.  RNNs  are  trained  with  the  a  modified  version  of  back
propagation     called    \textbf{Back    Propagation     Through    Time(BPTT)}
\cite{werbos1990backpropagation}.

RNNs in general are harder  to train and this is particularity evident when  the
BPTT is done over a larger number of time  steps. This is because  the gradients
simply converges to  zero  after  a  few  time  steps.  This  problem  known  as
\textbf{vanishing   gradients   problem}   is   a    well   studied   phenomenon
\cite{bengio1994learning}.

To alleviate  the  vanishing  gradients problem,  a special  architecture called
\textbf{Long Short Term Memory(LSTM)} \cite{hochreiter1997long} is used. An LSTM
cell is shown in \label{fig:lstm}.

LSTM cells has separate internal memory vector and has three gates--forget gate,
add gate, and output gate. To understand the Mathematical intuition behind these
gates,  let us consider  a LSTM cell in  a  hidden state  $h$  and internal cell
memory  vector $c_{t-1}$. At  time $t$, the cell  takes  input  $x_t$,  previous
output  $h_{t-1}$  and  update the  cell memory to $c_{t}$,  produces the output
$h_{t}$. The forget computes a vector  size $c$ between  0  and  1. This  vector
determines who  information should be  preserved  and  what  should be forgotten
based on the current input  $x_t$ as shown in \ref{fig:lstm_forget}. This vector
is  later  multiplied with  the  cell  memory.  If  the  vector  is  all  zeros,
multiplying makes all  cell  state to forget everything while all ones  preserve
everything.  Then  the add gate computes which  parts in  the cell  states to be
updates as shown in  \ref{fig:lstm_add} and the new  data to be updated as shown
in \ref{fig:lstm_add1}. Finally  the output gate generates the output  $h_t$ and
does not modify the cell state as shown in \ref{fig:lstm_output}.


\section{Traditional Machine Translation}


\subsection{Evaluation score} Translation is a hard task to define an evaluation
score to  measure how  well a model  is performing due to inherent complexity of
the task. The most widely  used evaluation metric is called Bilingual Evaluation
Understudy(BLEU) \cite{papineni2002bleu}.  Depends on  modified n-gram precision
(or  co-occurrence). Needs  lots of target sentences for better results. Despite
being the most widely used metric, many researchers have expressed concern about
the    effectiveness     of     the     metric     \cite{zhang2004interpreting},
\cite{callison2006re}, \cite{ananthakrishnan2007some}.  Consider  the  following
translation candidates


\begin{itemize}
  \item Candidate 1: It is  a  guide to action which ensures that  the  military
        always obey  the commands the  party.
  \item Candidate 2: It is  toinsure the troops  forever  hearing  the  activity
        guidebook that party  direct.
\end{itemize}


to be evaluated against the set of three reference translations.


\begin{itemize}
  \item Reference 1: It is a guide to action that ensures that the military will
        forever heed Party commands.
  \item Reference 2: It is the  guiding  principle which guarantees the military
        forces always being under the command of the Party.
  \item Reference 3: It  is  the  practical  guide  for  the army always to heed
        directions of the party.
\end{itemize}


The  BLUEs core idea is to use  count the  number  of N-gram  matches. The match
could  be position-independent. Reference could be matched multiple times. These
steps are linguistically-motivated.


Candidate  1:  \red{It is  a  guide to action which  ensures  that  the military
always} obey \red{the commands of the party}. \\
Reference 1: \red{It is a guide  to action} that \red{ensures that the military}
will forever heed \red{Party commands}. \\
Reference  2:  It  is  the  guiding principle  \red{which}  guarantees \red{the}
military forces \red{always}  being under  \red{the} command \red{of} the Party.
\\
Reference 3: It is the practical guide for the army always to heed directions of
the party. \\
N-gram Precision: 17


Candidate 2: \red{It is to} insure \red {the} troops \red {forever} hearing \red
{the} activity guidebook \red{that party} direct. \\
Reference 1: \red {It is} a guide \red {to} action \red {that} ensures that \red
{the} military will  \red{forever} heed \red{Party} commands. \\ Reference 2: It
is \red{the} guiding principle which guarantees the
military forces always being under the command of the Party. \\ Reference 3:  It
is the practical guide for the army always to heed directions of the party. \\
N-gram Precision: 8


Thus candidate 1 is better.
\textbf{Issues with N-gram precision}


Candidate: \red{the the the the the the the.} \\
Reference 1: \red{The} cat is on the mat. \\
Reference 2: There is a cat on the mat. \\


\textbf{\red{N-gram Precision: 7 and BLEU: 1}}


This result is  very misleading. Thus the following modified BLEU score is often
used.


\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
    \hline

    \textbf{Algorithm}  & \textbf{Example}  \\

    \hline

    Count the max number of times & Ref 1: The cat is on the mat.  \\
    a word occurs in any single reference & Ref 2: There is a cat on the mat. \\
    & âtheâ has max count 2 \\

    \hline

    Clip the total count of & Unigram count = 7 \\
    each candidate word & Clipped unigram count = 2 \\
    &Total no. of counts = 7 \\

    \hline

    Modified N-gram & Modified-ngram precision: \\
    Precision equal to & Clipped count = 2 \\
    Clipped count/ & Total no. of counts =7 \\
    Total no. of candidate word & Modified-ngram precision = 2/7\\

    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}


N-grams with different Ns are used but 4 is most common metric.


\subsection{Phrase based Machine Translation (PBMT)}
Traditionally there exists two types of machine translation systems:

\begin{itemize}

  \item \textbf{The Rule-based Approach}
        The  source language text is analyzed using parsers and/or morphological
        tools   and   transformed  into    intermediary   representation.   This
        representation  is  used  to  generate  target  sentence.  The rules are
        written  by human  experts. As  a large number of  rules is  required to
        capture  the  phenomena  of natural language,  this is a  time consuming
        process.  As the set of rules grows over time, it gets more and more
        complicated to extend it and ensure consistency.

  \item \textbf{The Data-driven Approach}
        In the data-driven  approach, bilingual and monolingual corpora are used
        as main knowledge source.  In the statistical approach, MT is treated as
        a  decision problem:  given the  source  language  sentence,  we have to
        decide  for the  target language  sentence that is the best translation.
        Then,  Bayes rule  and  statistical  decision theory are used to address
        this decision problem.
\end{itemize}


For a given sentence in source language $f^{I} = f_1\ldots f_i\ldots f_{I} $, we
need to find the sentence $e^{I} = e_1\ldots e_i\ldots e_{I}$ in target sentence
by applying Bayes rule to find the sentence that minimizes the expected loss


\begin{equation*}
e^{I} =  \argmin_{I,e^{I}} \Bigg\{
  \sum_{I^{'} } Pr(e^{\prime i^\prime} | f^J) \cdot L(e^I, e^{\prime i^\prime})
\Bigg\}
\end{equation*}


Here  $L(e^I, e^{\prime i^\prime})$ denotes loss function under construction. It
measures  the loss  (or errors) of a  candidate translation $e^{I}$ assuming the
correct translation is $e^{\prime i^\prime}$. If the loss function is assumed to
be 0-1  loss meaning  zero if wrong and 1 if correct, then the Bayes rule can be
simplified to,


\begin{equation*}
  e^{I} = \argmax_{I,e^{I}} \Bigg\{Pr(e^{\prime i^\prime} | f^J) \Bigg\}
\end{equation*}


Phrase  based  Machine  Translation  the  were widely  scalable  models  in  the
beginning of the millennium \cite{koehn2003statistical}. The model works  at the
level of phrases instead of words and had a lot of individual components but the
core idea is learning statistical patterns in training data.

Some of the major components used in the PBMT were


\begin{itemize}
  \item Sentence  alignment:   Gale   and  Church  Algorithm  based  on  Dynamic
        programming \cite{lewis1994sequential}.
  \item Word alignment: Expectation Maximization.
  \item Phrases generation: Heuristic based complex algorithms.
  \item Phrase lookup: Statistical matching.
  \item Beam search:  For generating target sentence.  Beam search is a generic
        algorithm that is used even in the latest NMT systems.
\end{itemize}


Beam search in general is a heuristic search  algorithm that explores a graph by
expanding the most promising node in a limited set. In machine translation, beam
search is used to generate  a set of most likely sentence given a input sentence
by retaining  only the most promising  translations. Number of sentence  is kept
constant.


\section{Neural Machine Translation (NMT)}
Though usage of  neural networks did  not  yield  promising results in the early
years, the recurrent neural networks started to  achieve  performance comparable
to       PBMT       as       in       \cite{kalchbrenner2013recurrent}       and
\cite{hermann2013multilingual}. Most  of  the  early architectures  were  simple
encoder-decoder architectures. An simple working of encoder-decoder architecture
for machine translation is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:enc_dec}. The architecture has
an encoder that takes a sentence in source language and encodes it into a vector
$S$ of fixed length. The decoder takes the embedding $S$ as  input and generates
the sentence in the target language. Some of the major drawbacks with the simple
architecture is that


\begin{enumerate}
  \item The  encoder  has to  encode all the  information in the source sentence
        into fixed size embedding $S$.
  \item The decoder  never  sees  the  actual  input  sentence  and  has to rely
        completely on $S$ for generating target sentence.
  \item Having fixed size embedding vector makes the architecture less flexible.
        Smaller size means less  information where  as using larger vector means
        for smaller sentences we need zero padding and more computation time.
\end{enumerate}


\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=.99\linewidth]{img/context.png}
  \caption{Context for machine translation}
  \label{fig:context}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Jointly learning to align and translate} \label{sec:JT}
The paper  \cite{bahdanau2014neural}  address this  issue of having a fixed size
embedding  by  introducing  the  idea of  context  \ref{fig:context}.  The  main
proposal was to use,


\begin{enumerate}
  \item Encoder  outputs a  hidden  representation  for  each word in the source
        sentence $F_s$.
  \item One context vector $C$ in the size of the input sentence that has values
        between 0 and 1.
  \item Each element of the embedding  $F_s$  is multiplied with one  element in
        $C$.
\end{enumerate}


The whole embedding  is made available  to  the decoder and $C$ describes  which
part of the embedding should be focused to generate  the current  word based  on
the previous word.

Encoder  RNN,  at each  input step t,  generates  hidden state,  $h_t  =  f(x_t,
h_{t-1})$.

Unlike in the previous models where only the last hidden state is made available
to the decoder, this paper  provided  all  the hidden state  and also a  context
vector that has a weight for each of the hidden vector. The context vector helps
the decoder to focus on a part of the sentence. $c = q(\{h_1,\cdots,h_{T_x}\})$.


The decoder is  trained to predict the next work $y_t$ given  the context vector
$c$ and all previously predicted words $\{ y_1, \cdots, y_{t-1}\}$


\begin{equation*}
  p(y) = \prod^{T}_{t=1} p(y_t | \{ y_1, \cdots, y_{t-1}\} ,c )
\end{equation*}


With RNN, each conditional probability is modeled as,


\begin{equation*}
  p(y_t | \{ y_1, \cdots, y_{t-1}\}, c) = g(y_{t-1}, s_t, c)
\end{equation*}


where  $s_t$ is the hidden  state  of  the RNN. The context vector  for a  input
sentence $i$, is  computed  as  a weighted  sum of  hidden states of the encoder
(also known as \textbf{annotations})


\begin{equation*}
  c_i = \sum_{j=1}^{T_{x}} \alpha_{ij} h_j
\end{equation*}


\begin{equation*}
  \alpha_{ij} = \frac{ exp(e_{ij})}{ \sum_{k=1}^{T_x} exp (e_{ik})}
\end{equation*}

where, $$ e_{ij}  = a(s_{i-1},  h_j)  $$ is the alignment model that  scores how
well the inputs around the $j$ and the output at the position $i$ match.


A   feedforward  neural  network   is  used  as   the  alignment  model  and  is
\textbf{jointly trained} with all the NMT system as a whole.


\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[height=8cm]{img/contextres.png}
  \caption{Visualization of the context in action}
  \label{fig:contextvis}
\end{figure}


The  functionality   of   the   context  vector  is   visualized  in   the  Fig.
\ref{fig:contextvis}.  For   example,  the   French  language   has  the   words
\textquotedblleft European Economic Area\textquotedblright exists in the reverse
order as \textquotedblleft zone \'{e}conomique europ\'{e}enne\textquotedblright.
The context learns to focus on the correct order for the decoder.


The  idea of context  used in the paper was adapted by the MT research community
with   the  name   of  attention.  Several  attention  mechanism  were  proposed
\cite{luong2015effective},  \cite{cho2014learning},  \cite{gregor2015draw}.  The
context proposed in  label{sec:JT} to align hidden state  $h_t$ with each source
hidden state $\bar{h_s}$ can be formulated a,


\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    a_t(s) & = align(h_t,\bar{h_s}) \\
    & = \frac{exp(score(h_t,\bar{h_s}))}{\sum_{s'} exp(score(h_t,\bar{h_s'}))}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}


The new attention mechanisms proposed are,


\begin{equation*}
  align(h_t,\bar{h_s}) = \begin{cases}
    h_t^T\bar{h_s} & \text{dot} \\
    h_t^TW_a\bar{h_s} & \text{general} \\
    v_a^T tanh (W_a[h_t;\bar{h_s'}]) & \text{concat}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}


These mechanisms  are shown  do perform better  in certain scenarios but none of
them is shown to be the best.


\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{img/birnn.png}
  \caption{Bi-directional Encoder}
  \label{fig:birnn}
\end{figure}


This paper  also made  use of  the  bi-directional  LSTM  in  the layers  of the
Encoder. Just like  an  LSTM that has an internal memory to comprehend  the past
states, the LSTM also comprehends the words that comes next in the sentence.  It
has two internal state---one for past states and one for the future state. A bi-
directional LSTM is shown in \ref{fig:birnn}.

The whole model is trained with standard maximum-likelihood  error  minimization
$\mathbb{O}_{ML}(\Theta) = \sum_{i=1}^N log P_\Theta(Y^{*(i)} |  X^{(i)}) $ with
stochastic gradient  descent(SGD) on a mini-batch of 80 sentences. For the first
time, the BLEU score was comparable to phrase based machine  translation system.
But  the fact  that there  are  no  individual pieces  in the  model was a great
benefit and the  research  community started to  consider  neural systems as  an
viable alternative phrase based machine translation system.


\subsection{Sequence  to Sequence models.}
\label{sec:seq}  With  in  an  year,  more   deep   and   powerful  models  were
computationally possible. Taking the availability of the computational power  to
advantage  a  new  framework  for  learning  sequence  to sequence  mapping were
proposed. A sequence to sequence model formulated as $$ p(y_1, \cdots, y_T| x_1,
\cdots, x_T) =  \prod_{t=1}^{T} p(y_t| v, y_1,  \cdots,  y_{t-1})$$ where $v$ is
the internal memory of the RNNs. With more powerful RNNs, this model can be used
to  learn a  variety  of  tasks  like  speech  recognition,  handwritten  digits
recognition,   machine   translation,    etc    as   shown    in    the    paper
\cite{sutskever2014sequence}

A simple  sequence  to sequence  model is shown in Fig.  \ref{fig:seq}.  Just by
making  the  model more  deeper,  without  any  special  treatment  for  machine
translation, the paper achieved  state-of-the art results. The model as  trained
on WMT  English  to French dataset  with 12M sentences consisting of 348M French
words and 304M  English words using 160,000 of  the  most frequent words for the
source  language  and 80,000 of the most frequent words for the target language.
Every out-of-vocabulary word was replaced with a special \textbf{UNK} token. The
network has  4  LSTM layers with 1000 LSTM cells in each  layer. The  paper used
1000  dimensional word  embedding to represent the words as vector following the
word2vec paper \cite{mikolov2013distributed}. word2vec formulated the problem of
learning word embedding as an  energy maximization problem using a simple neural
network  with just one hidden layer. The  energy maximized  is  called  Negative
sampling. The resulting vector embedding is empirically shown to have arithmetic
properties.  i.e. $\,$France  -  Paris  + Germany  is roughly equal to Berlin as
shown in Fig. \ref{fig:wordvec}. The paper an impressive BLEU score of 33.3 even
without doing anything specific for machine translation.

\subsection{Google Neural Machine System}
Most  likely  Google  runs   the  worlds  biggest  machine  translation  service
supporting  103 languages(at the time of writing this article)  serving  about a
billion  query  every day. Google  translate  team  published  a  detailed paper
describing their neural machine translation  system \cite{wu2016google}. In  the
following section we  will discuss  the key  ideas described in the  paper. This
paper is  very unique in the sense that it is much more than an  academic paper.
The  paper explains  most of the components of  the  system  including a lot  of
engineering  details and  also has a lot  of  components  that are inspired from
other recent breakthroughs in machine translation and  deep learning research in
general.  The basic architecture is heavily inspired by the jointly  learning to
align and  translate  \ref{sec:JT}  and  \ref{sec:seq}. The core architecture is
shown in Fig. \ref{fig:gnmt1}. It combines the idea of context with the a deeper
sequence  to sequence  encoder- decoder  model with bi-directional LSTM  in  the
initial layers  of  the  encoder. Both  the  encoder  and decoder contains eight
layer.  It   also   made  use  of  the  Residual   connections   introduced   in
\cite{he2016deep}. Residual connection  are helpful in alleviating the vanishing
gradients problem in an interesting manner  as shown in \ref{fig:residual}. In a
DNN  each  layer  can  be  interpreted as transforming  the  input  $x$ to a new
manifold by learning  $F(x)$  but in a residual network only learn the change to
be  applied to  the  input  ($x  +  F(x)$).  There  is always an  identity  skip
connection between layers helping in the constant gradient  flow which otherwise
might vanish. The residual learning enables training very deep networks as shown
in Fig. \ref{fig:gnmtres}.

The author  also tried to use a enhanced  cost function. The usual cost function
maximized    by    the   training    process    is   the   maximum    likelihood
$$\mathbb{O}_{ML}(\Theta) = \sum_{i=1}^N log P_\Theta(Y^{*(i)} | X^{(i)}) $$ but
this does not directly correspond to  the BLEU score. To improve  the  BLEU  the
authors  proposed  the  following cost  function.  $$ \mathbb{O}_{ML}(\Theta)  =
\sum_{i=1}^N  \sum_{Y=\mathbb{Y}}^N   log  P_\Theta(Y^{*(i)}   |  X^{(i)})  r(Y,
Y^{*(i)} ) $$ where  $r(\textperiodcentered)$ is per-sentence score  computed as
an expectation over all $Y$ up to certain-length.

In terms of the training process, just one encoder  and one decoder  is used for
all  language  pairs. The authors  reported several nice properties of the joint
language training. One highlight  is that  this enables zero-shot learning.  The
system is able  to translate between the  language  pairs it never  saw  in  the
training data. Also the languages for which huge  training data exists benefited
from the joint training. The zero shot learning property  is discussed in detail
the  paper  \cite{johnson2016google}.  To  enable  a single decoder to  generate
target  sentence for  all  the  languages,  the  input  text  is  suffixed  with
additional  tokes  like $<\_\_EN\_\_>, <\_\_FR\_\_>, <\_\_DE\_\_>, <\_\_ES\_\_>$
indicating the target language to be generated.

A simple sequence  to sequence  model is shown in  Fig. \ref{fig:seq}.  Just  by
making the model  more deeper as in Fig. \ref{fig:seqdeep}, without any  special
treatment for machine translation, the paper achieved state-of-the art  results.
The  model as trained  on  WMT  English  to  French dataset with  12M  sentences
consisting of 348M French words and 304M English words using 160,000 of the most
frequent words for the source language and 80,000 of the most frequent words for
the target language. Every  out-of-vocabulary word was replaced with  a  special
\textbf{UNK} token.  The network has 4  LSTM layers with 1000 LSTM cells in each
layer. The paper used 1000 dimensional  word embedding to represent the words as
vector  following  the word2vec  paper  \cite{mikolov2013distributed}.  word2vec
formulated  the  problem  of learning word embedding as an  energy  maximization
problem  using a  simple neural network with just  one  hidden layer. The energy
maximized  is  called  Negative  sampling.  The resulting  vector  embedding  is
empirically shown to  have  arithmetic properties.  i.e. $\,$France  -  Paris  +
Germany is roughly equal to Berlin as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:wordvec}. The paper
an impressive  BLEU  score  of  33.3 even without  doing  anything  specific for
machine translation.




One another interesting aspect of the GNMT is the use of Quantizable Model and Quantized Inference. Since GNMT has to serve a huge volume of users in the production, the service is very computationally intensive making hard for low latency translation difficult. Quantized Inference is the process of using low precession arithmetic operations during the inference. The idea of using low precession arithmetic got inference has been tried since the early days of neural networks. In the recent years, the authors in \cite{wu2016quantized} successfully demonstrated that a CNN training can be sped up by a factor of 4-6 with minimal loss of accuracy in the classification task. More interestingly \cite{li2016ternary} showed that weights of the neural networks can be quantized to just three states, -1,0,1. But most of these success are mostly restricted to CNNs. In the paper GNMT team did the same of RNNs. To achieve this, the model were constrained during training time. The nature of LSTMs remembering state across multiple time steps posts additional challenges in quantizing RNNs. he forward computation of an LSTM stack with residual connections is modified to the following: 


  
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
c^{'i}_t,m^i_t    & = LSTM_i(c^{i}_{t-1},m^i_{t-1}, x^{i-1}_t; W^i ) \\
c^{i}_t		  & =  max(-\delta, min(\delta,c^{'i}_t )) \\
x^{'i}_t	  & = m^{i}_t + x^{i-1}_t \\
x^{i}_t		  & =  max(-\delta, min(\delta,x^{'i}_t )) \\
c^{'i}_t,m^i_t    & = LSTM_{i+1}(c^{i+1}_{t-1},m^{i+1}_{t-1}, x^{i}_t; W^{i+1} ) \\
c^{i+1}_t		  & =  max(-\delta, min(\delta,c^{'i+1}_t ))
\end{split}
\end{equation}
